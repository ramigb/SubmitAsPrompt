# SubmitAsPrompt
Is a very simply chrome extension that allows you to submit highlighted text from an open tab to ChatGPT and get a response. Please note this was a weekend project I may and may not iterate over it.

## How to install
1. Clone repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ 
3. Make sure Developer mode is turned on
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repo

## TODO
1. Allow response feedback (e.g. the user can submit change requests back to GPT)
2. Enable caching
3. Save multiple templates and choose between them when sending highlighted text


## Maybe
1. Prompt fix suggestion (aka Prompt engineering)
2. Integrate with Auto-GPT
